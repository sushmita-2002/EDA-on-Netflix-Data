# EDA-on-Netflix-Data
This project is a product of analysis of Netflix dataset. The dataset I have used for the Netflix data analytics task consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix as of 2021.
• To begin the task of analyzing Netflix data, I’ll start by looking at the distribution of content ratings on Netflix.
• Then I see the top 5 successful directors and actors on this platform.
• The next thing to analyze from this data is the trend of production over the years on Netflix.
• At last, to conclude my analysis, I will analyze the sentiment of content on Netflix.
